Since this was the first program I made using java.swing, java.awt, java.awt.event, and javax.swing, I decided to make a simple game to raise awareness and understanding of color blindness. </br>

## How the game works 

Box: You have to match the corresponding color of the first double circle you meet. You are only allowed to change your color once. Also, you cannot change the color when you are directly near the double circle. </br>

Circle: You have to match the corresponding color of the second encounterment of the box. You are only allowed to change your color once. Also, you cannot change the color when you are directly near the box. </br>

### Other
The frame is resizable. The greater the x dimension of the frame, the slower the box moves. Thus, it resembles a easier mode.

### Next Steps
There will be a pop-up modes where it will also include other types of color blindess into account.
